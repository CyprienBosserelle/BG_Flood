## Tutorials

Two differents types of tutorial are proposed, some are benchmark configurations, with basics inputs generated during the tutorials, the other ones are more realistic cases with inputs provided (to download).

### Benchmark tutorials

Here is a list of all the available tutorials:

- [Jet tutorial (Julia)](tutorial/TutorialJetJulia.md): Simple tutorial presenting a jet simulation in BG_Flood. All imputs files are generated manually or with Julia.

- [Gaussian wave](tutorial/Gaussian_Wave_Julia.md): Simple tutoral presenting a Gaussian wave propagation

- [Transpacific tsunami](tutorial/Transpacific_tsunami.md): Simple tutorial presenting a transpacific tsunami propagation

- Monia tutorial (Julia) (still in construction)

### Real configuration tutorials

- [River flooding tutorial](tutorial/TutorialRiver.md): Simple tutorial that go through the construction of a simple `BG_param.txt` file for fluvial and pluvial flooding. Some realistic input files are provided.

- Tsunami propagation  (still in construction)
