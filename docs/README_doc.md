# Documentation Generation

The documentation is generated using:
- Doxygen to extract the code information (from *.cu, *.h and *.cpp files)
- Mkdocs-material to generate the markdown part of the documentation
- mkdoxy pluggin is added convert XML files generated by doxygen in markdown and include them in the documentation.

The documentation is located in the "docs" folder. Mkdocs documentation is configured using the mkdocs.yml file (located in root folder). The documentation set-up (librarys...) is saved in the pyproject.toml.

The documentation is then deployed directly from the github page of the code, using a workflow action. When this action is triggered, the documentation pages are updated and pushed in a special branch: "gh-page" and deplyed from there.

Different pluggins have been added to improve the documentation:
- mkdocs-awesome-nav : to improve the navigation and use of glob type notation to get for example all the md files in a folder
