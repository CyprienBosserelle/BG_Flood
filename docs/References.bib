abstract = {A GPU-parallel numerical model for the solution of the 2D Shallow Water Equations, based on a novel type of grid called Block-Uniform Quadtree (BUQ), is presented. BUQ grids are based on a data structure which allows to exploit the computational capability of GPUs with minimum overheads, while discretizing the domain with non-uniform resolution. Different cases have been simulated in order to assess the efficiency of the BUQ grids. Theoretical and laboratory tests demonstrate that speed-ups of up to one order of magnitude can be achieved in comparison with uniform Cartesian grids. In the simulation of a hypothetical flood event induced by a levee breach in a real 83\'{z}km long river reach, with maximum resolution of 5\'{z}m, a ratio of physical to computational time of about 12 was obtained, opening scenarios of quasi real-time 2D simulations in large domains, still retaining a high resolution where necessary. Shallow Water Equations parallel numerical scheme suitable for GPU.Novel Block-Uniform Quadtree (BUQ) grid-type, exploiting the computational capability of GPUs with non-uniform resolution.Very large domain can be simulated (38\'{z}km river reach) with high resolution (2\'{z}m).Speed-up of one order of magnitude is achieved, in comparison with Uniform resolution Cartesian Grids.High ratio between physical and computational time which enables real-time simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Coastal flooding exacerbated by climate change is recognised as a major global threat which is expected to impact more than a quarter of all people currently residing in Pacific Island countries. While most research in the last decade has focused on understanding the dynamics and impacts of future coastal flooding from extreme sea levels, the effects of relative sea level rise (RSLR) on exacerbating tsunami hazards are not well understood. Far-field or distant sourced tsunamis tend to have relatively lower impacts in Pacific Island states compared with locally sourced events, but there is limited understanding of how the impact of far-field tsunamis changes over time due to RSLR. Using the hydrodynamics software BG-Flood, we modelled the Tōhoku-oki tsunami from propagation to inundation in Samoa under incremental SLR to examine the effects that RSLR has on changing the exposure of the built environment (e.g., buildings) to a far-field tsunami. Outputs of maximum tsunami inundation and flow depth intensities which incorporate incremental SLR were then combined with digital representations of buildings and depth-damage functions in the RiskScape multi-hazard risk modelling software to assess the changes in building exposure over time. Results suggest that the impacts of Tōhoku-oki-type far-field tsunamis become significant once RSLR reaches 1 m above present levels. Present-day building exposure will increase by approx. 500% with 1 m RSLR by 2080–2130, and approx. 2350% with 2 m RSLR by as early as 2130–2140. These findings provide useful insights for application to tsunami hazard risk assessments under changing sea level conditions in analogous island environments.},
