abstract = {A GPU-parallel numerical model for the solution of the 2D Shallow Water Equations, based on a novel type of grid called Block-Uniform Quadtree (BUQ), is presented. BUQ grids are based on a data structure which allows to exploit the computational capability of GPUs with minimum overheads, while discretizing the domain with non-uniform resolution. Different cases have been simulated in order to assess the efficiency of the BUQ grids. Theoretical and laboratory tests demonstrate that speed-ups of up to one order of magnitude can be achieved in comparison with uniform Cartesian grids. In the simulation of a hypothetical flood event induced by a levee breach in a real 83\'{z}km long river reach, with maximum resolution of 5\'{z}m, a ratio of physical to computational time of about 12 was obtained, opening scenarios of quasi real-time 2D simulations in large domains, still retaining a high resolution where necessary. Shallow Water Equations parallel numerical scheme suitable for GPU.Novel Block-Uniform Quadtree (BUQ) grid-type, exploiting the computational capability of GPUs with non-uniform resolution.Very large domain can be simulated (38\'{z}km river reach) with high resolution (2\'{z}m).Speed-up of one order of magnitude is achieved, in comparison with Uniform resolution Cartesian Grids.High ratio between physical and computational time which enables real-time simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Coastal flooding exacerbated by climate change is recognised as a major global threat which is expected to impact more than a quarter of all people currently residing in Pacific Island countries. While most research in the last decade has focused on understanding the dynamics and impacts of future coastal flooding from extreme sea levels, the effects of relative sea level rise (RSLR) on exacerbating tsunami hazards are not well understood. Far-field or distant sourced tsunamis tend to have relatively lower impacts in Pacific Island states compared with locally sourced events, but there is limited understanding of how the impact of far-field tsunamis changes over time due to RSLR. Using the hydrodynamics software BG-Flood, we modelled the Tōhoku-oki tsunami from propagation to inundation in Samoa under incremental SLR to examine the effects that RSLR has on changing the exposure of the built environment (e.g., buildings) to a far-field tsunami. Outputs of maximum tsunami inundation and flow depth intensities which incorporate incremental SLR were then combined with digital representations of buildings and depth-damage functions in the RiskScape multi-hazard risk modelling software to assess the changes in building exposure over time. Results suggest that the impacts of Tōhoku-oki-type far-field tsunamis become significant once RSLR reaches 1 m above present levels. Present-day building exposure will increase by approx. 500% with 1 m RSLR by 2080–2130, and approx. 2350% with 2 m RSLR by as early as 2130–2140. These findings provide useful insights for application to tsunami hazard risk assessments under changing sea level conditions in analogous island environments.},

abstract = {This paper presents a finite volume scheme on structured grids to simulate shallow flows over complex terrain. The situation of shallow downhill flow over a step is particularly challenging for most shallow water schemes. We study this situation in detail and devise a novel second-order reconstruction strategy, which gives superior results over former hydrostatic reconstruction (HR) schemes. The reconstruction step is based on a recent first-order hydrostatic reconstruction HR method, which improves shallow flows over steps. The proposed second-order scheme is well-balanced, positivity-preserving, and handles dry cells. When compared with the original HR, we lower the computational burden by using a simplified quadrature for the bed slope source term. We test the scheme on various benchmark setups to assess accuracy and robustness, where the method produces comparable results to other HR-based schemes in most cases and superior results in the case of shallow downhill flow over steps. The novel second-order scheme is capable of simulating large-scale real-world flood scenarios fast and accurately.}

abstract = {Discretisation of the friction terms to ensure numerical stability and accuracy remains to be challenging for the development of robust numerical schemes to solve the shallow water equations (SWEs), particularly for applications involving very shallow flows (e.g. overland flows and wet/dry fronts) over complex domain topography. The key challenge is to ensure relaxation of the flow towards an equilibrium state characterised by the balance between friction and gravity in a computationally efficient way. To overcome this numerical challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach for discretising the friction source terms in the SWEs in the context of an explicit finite volume method. The overall numerical scheme adopts the HLLC Riemann solver and surface reconstruction method (SRM) to explicitly discretise the flux and bed slope source terms. Whilst a fully implicit scheme is used to handle the friction source terms, solution to the implicit formulation is analytically derived to explicitly update the flow variables. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed scheme effectively resolves the issue associated with stiff relaxation without necessity to use an iteration method and it supports efficient simulation using time steps controlled only by the Courant–Friedrichs–Levy (CFL) condition. The current friction term discretisation scheme is not coupled with flux and bed slope calculation and therefore may be readily implemented in any other explicit finite volume SWE models. After being successfully validated against two benchmark tests with analytical solutions, the resulting new SWE model is applied to reproduce a rainfall-flooding event in the Upper Lee catchment in the UK.}
