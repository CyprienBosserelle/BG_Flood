BG\+\_\+\+Flood model reads an instruction file (or {\itshape param} file) that tells the model what to do and what forcing files to read. when instructions are not explicitely given the model will use the default value. How to use the param file is important for making BG\+\_\+\+Flood do what you want it to do.

By default this instruction file is called {\ttfamily BG\+\_\+param.\+txt}.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{BG\+\_\+param.\+txt}\label{Manual_autotoc_md22}
All the model inputs are controlled by the {\ttfamily BG\+\_\+param.\+txt} file. It is a simple text file that contains the parameters of the model that the user wishes to change. While it is easy to build such file manually but also it is easy to use script and/or programming language to generate and modify text file to automatically to build and run many simulations.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysubsubsection{How to use the BG\+\_\+param.\+txt file}\label{Manual_autotoc_md23}
\mbox{\hyperlink{structModel}{Model}} parameters can be modified in the file by specifying the parameter name, the equal sign, the desired value(s) for the parameter and optionally a semi-\/column ;

\end{DoxyCode}
 \hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsubsection{General comment about input files}\label{Manual_autotoc_md24}
Some parameters expect a filename (e.\+g. {\ttfamily bathy}). While the model will accept any extension there are a couple of requirement. For spatially varying inputs, the extension controls how the file is read. You can use ESRI ascii grids {\ttfamily .asc}, mid-\/depth files {\ttfamily .md} or Net\+CDF {\ttfamily .nc}. Net\+CDF files are recommended and expected to have the {\ttfamily .nc} extension. Since Net\+CDF files can have several variables you can enforce (recommended) the variable being read by appending {\ttfamily ?var} to the file name (e.\+g. {\ttfamily bathy = mybathyfile.\+nc?z}).

For spatially and temporally varying input (e.\+g. wind or atmospheric pressure) a/multiple Net\+CDF file with a 3D variable is expected (see \href{\#wind-atm-pressure-forcing}{\texttt{ here}}).

Where the file input is a timeserie (e.\+g. boundary forcing), then the file extension is ignored but a text file is expected.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{List of Parameters}\label{Manual_autotoc_md25}
Remember that the only required parameter to run the model is the bathymetry file. But if you want to run something fun you will need to specify boundary conditions, initial conditions and/or some forcings.

\mbox{\hyperlink{ParameterList}{Full list of the parameters}}\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsection{Bathymetry/topography files}\label{Manual_autotoc_md26}
Input bathymetry data as a regular grid using {\ttfamily .asc}, {\ttfamily .nc}, {\ttfamily .md}. This is a required parameter that ultimately also defines the extend of the model domain and model resolution (if not defined by the user).

{\ttfamily bathy = My\+\_\+bathy\+\_\+file.\+asc}

The correct way of reading the file will be dedicated by the file extension. For {\ttfamily .nc} (netcdf) files you can specify the name of the variable in the file as\+: {\ttfamily mybathyfile.\+nc?myvar} (will look for {\ttfamily zb} if none are specified).

This input file is critical as it defines the extent of the model grid and the base resolution in the model.

{\itshape Note}\+: Different files can be provided to the code (using the instruction line multiple times). The code will use the last one having information at a given location when interpolating the data to create the bottom elevation (zb) variable.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysubsection{Conputational mesh}\label{Manual_autotoc_md27}
{\bfseries{BG-\/\+Flood generates its own mesh.}} By default, it is a quad regular mesh based on the DEM (Digital Elevation \mbox{\hyperlink{structModel}{Model}}) extend and resolution. The extend of the mesh and resolution of the mesh can be modify by the user. The mesh can also be refined/coarsen in areas or following patterns prescribed by the user.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsubsection{Masking}\label{Manual_autotoc_md28}
Parts of the input bathymetry can be masked and excluded from the computation. The model extent (and locations of side boundaries) will remain the same but entire blocks can be removed from the computational memory. These area will appear as NaN in the output file. The input grid is first devided in blocks of 16x16. If all the value within a block exceed the mask value (9999 as default) then that block is excluded from memory and no computation will occur there. An \char`\"{}area of interest\char`\"{} (AOI) can also be used to select a part of the domain. If none of the cells of a block is located in this area, that block will be excluded from memory. The AOI is prefered other the mask method as the later can create waterfalls on the borders of the domain, specially if the rain-\/on-\/grid method is used.

There are no fancy treatment of the boundaries of masked blocks so it is safer to select a mask threshold ({\ttfamily mask}) to keep most of the masked are dry. If water tries to cross to a masked block, The boundary of blocks are treated as Neumann (no gradient) boundaries so the bathymetry of the 2 cells adjacent to a masked block are set to the same value (the value of the second cell removed from the masked block).\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{Boundaries}\label{Manual_autotoc_md29}
Four type of boundaries can be applied at the edge of the model. By default neumann (no perpendicular gradient) is applied.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\+: No slip (wall)
\item 1\+: Neumann
\item 2\+: dirichlets (water level )
\item 3\+: Absorbing (only 1D/perpendicular absorbion is implemented)
\item (4\+: $\sim$$\sim$ 2D Absorbing$\sim$$\sim$ (Not implemented yet))
\end{DoxyItemize}

For Boundary type 2 and 3 (Dirichlet and Absorbing) the level at the boundary level is imposed from a file so a file needs to be sepcified\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{left = 1;}
\DoxyCodeLine{right = mybndfile.txt,3;}
\DoxyCodeLine{top = mybndfile.txt,3;}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsubsection{Boundary file (for type 2 or 3)}\label{Manual_autotoc_md30}
Water level boundary file are needed to type 2 and 3 boundaries. The files are 2 (or more) columns, one with time in the first column and water level is the other(s). Note that the time step in the file doesn\textquotesingle{}t need to be constant. The model will linearly interpolated between steps in the file. The file can be either comma separated or tab separated. This is automatically detected.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md31}{}\doxyparagraph{Uniform boundary file}\label{Manual_autotoc_md31}
For uniform boundary condition (along the boundary axis) the files needs to be 2 column\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\# Water level boundary}}
\DoxyCodeLine{0.0  1.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{3600.0  1.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{36000.0  1.22}
\DoxyCodeLine{36060.0  1.25}
\DoxyCodeLine{36120.0  1.24}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md32}{}\doxyparagraph{Variable boundary file}\label{Manual_autotoc_md32}
For Variable boundary condition (along the boundary axis) the files needs to be 3+ columns. The boundary axis is then divided by the number of boundary column and the water level is interpolated between location. for example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\# Water level boundary}}
\DoxyCodeLine{0.0  1.2 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{3600.0  1.2 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{36000.0  1.22 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{36060.0  1.25 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{36120.0  1.24 0.0}

\end{DoxyCode}


Here the the water level on the near-\/end of the boundary (left for bottom and top bnds; bottom for left and right bnds) axis will vary between 1.\+2 and 1.\+25 but the far-\/end (right for bottom and top bnd and top for left and right bnds) will remain constant at 0.\+0.

Here is an example with 3 water level column\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{ \# Water level boundary}}
\DoxyCodeLine{0.0 0.0 1.2 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{3600.0 0.0 1.2 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{36000.0 0.0 1.2 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{36060.0 0.0 1.2 0.0}
\DoxyCodeLine{36120.0 0.0 1.2 0.0 }

\end{DoxyCode}


In this case both near and far end of the boundary axis will remain zero and the center of the boundary axis will be 1.\+2m.

There is no restriction in the number of columns. These values from each column will be forced uniformly spaced on the boundary and forcing in between will be linearly interpolated.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{Bottom friction}\label{Manual_autotoc_md33}
Bottom friction is applied implicitly in the model (applied to velocities after momentum and continuity equations are solved). There are 3 friction equations implemented defined in {\ttfamily BG\+\_\+param.\+txt} as {\ttfamily frictionmodel =}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\+: Basic Quadratic friction law (expecting the non-\/dimensional friction coefficient \textquotesingle{}cf\textquotesingle{} )
\item 1\+: Roughtness length model from Smart (expecting a $z_0$ parameter in \textquotesingle{}cf\textquotesingle{})
\item -\/1 Manning\textquotesingle{}s friction model (expecting a Manning n parameter \textquotesingle{}cf\textquotesingle{}) Quadratic friction is the default, with a uniform friction coefficient\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{frictionmodel = 0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cf = 0.001}

\end{DoxyCode}
 If a uniform friction is required add {\ttfamily cf=} to your {\ttfamily BG\+\_\+param.\+txt} with the desired value. {\ttfamily cf} keyword is also used for the $z0$ of Smart formulation and $n$ of the Manning formulation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For non-\/uniform friction parameter use the keyword {\ttfamily cfmap} or {\ttfamily roughnessmap} and assign an {\ttfamily .asc} or {\ttfamily .nc} file. For nc files you may need to supply the netcdf variable name\+: e.\+g. {\ttfamily cfmap=final\+\_\+rough.\+nc?zo}. The roughness grid does not need to match the model grid dimension and coarser friction grid will be interpolated to the model grid cells and model cells outside of the forcing domain will be extrapolated (nearest value).\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsection{Rivers and Area discharge}\label{Manual_autotoc_md34}
At this stage river can only be added to the model as a vertical discharge where the water is added to a rectangle on the model with no velocity. To add rivers add a line per river with the parameters\+: {\ttfamily river = Fluxfile,xstart,xend,ystart,yend;} where {\ttfamily Fluxfile} is a 2 column text file containing time and dicharge in m3/s; {\ttfamily xstart} is the left coordinate of the square where the vertical discharge is applied, {\ttfamily xend} is the right coordinate of the square, {\ttfamily ystart} is the bottom coordinate of the square and {\ttfamily yend} is the top coordinate of the square. Example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{river = Votualevu\_R.txt,1867430,1867455,3914065,3914090;}
\DoxyCodeLine{river = Mulomulo\_R.txt,1867052,1867072,3911853,3911873;}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{Wind atm pressure forcing}\label{Manual_autotoc_md35}
\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsubsection{Wind forcing (may contain bugs)}\label{Manual_autotoc_md36}
The hydrodynamics can be forced using a linear wind drag. the linear drag can be influenced with the keyword {\ttfamily Cd}. Wind input is defined with the keyword {\ttfamily windfiles=}. There are several ways to use the keyword. \hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md37}{}\doxyparagraph{spatially uniform txt file\+:}\label{Manual_autotoc_md37}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{windfiles=mywind.txt}

\end{DoxyCode}
 where {\ttfamily mywind.\+txt} is a text file with 3 column (time (in s), wind speed (m/s) and wind direction(degree North)). If the grid is in acoordinate system rotated from the north and a {\ttfamily grdalpha} is specified, the wind will be automatically rotated to the grid orientation.\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md38}{}\doxyparagraph{Spatially and time varying input}\label{Manual_autotoc_md38}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{windfiles=mywind.nc?uw,mywind.nc?vw}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Here two arguments separated with a comma are expected. The first argument is the netcdf file and variable name containing the U component of the wind (along the X axis) and the second argument is the netcdf file and variable name containing the V component of the wind (along the Y axis). Both can be in the same netcdf file as in the example or in separate netcdf files (add the variable name with a {\ttfamily ?} similarly to other netcdf input options). The dimension of the wind forcing grid does not need to match the model grid dimension and coarser forcing will be interpolated to the model grid cells and model cells outside of the forcing domain will be extrapolated (nearest value).\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md39}{}\doxysubsubsection{Atmospheric pressure forcing}\label{Manual_autotoc_md39}
Spatially constant atmospheric pressure forcing is not relevant so only spatially varying forcing is feasable. Like for the wind this is done through a netcdf file\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{atmpfile=myncfile.nc?atmpres}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The forcing pressure is expected to be in Pa and the effect of the atmospheric pressure gradient is calculated as the difference to a reference pressure {\ttfamily Paref=101300.\+0} converted to a height using {\ttfamily Pa2m=0.\+00009916}. If using h\+Pa your will need to also change the reference pressure to {\ttfamily Paref=1013.\+0} and the conversion parameter to {\ttfamily Pa2m=0.\+009916}. As with the wind forcing, the forcing grid does not need to match the model grid dimension and coarser forcing will be interpolated to the model grid cells and model cells outside of the forcing domain will be extrapolated (nearest value).\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md40}{}\doxysubsection{Outputs}\label{Manual_autotoc_md40}
There is two types of outputs\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item map outputs of 2D variables regularly through time.
\item time-\/series output of basic values, at a chosen position, at each time step.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md41}{}\doxysubsubsection{Map outputs}\label{Manual_autotoc_md41}
These maps are output as a nc file, with information on coordinates and blocks.

The map output can be modify by\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item defining a timestep (in s) for these outputs\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{outputtimestep = 3600.0;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item changing the set of variables in the output file (from the list given in the manual) 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{outvars = zs,h,u,v,zb,hmax,Umax,hUmax,twet;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item changing the name of the output file\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{outfile = Results\_tuto\_basicRun.nc;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item choosing one or more zones to outputs (by default, the full domain is output)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{outzone=MyZoneName.nc,x1,x2,y1,y2;}
\DoxyCodeLine{outzone=MyZoneNameb.nc,x1b,x2b,y1b,y2b;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item saving the output as float (variables are saved as short integer by default.)\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{smallnc = 0;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}

By default, the variables outputs are the one listed in the following paragraph\+: Default snapshot outputs. \hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md42}{}\doxyparagraph{Default snapshot outputs}\label{Manual_autotoc_md42}

\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md49}{}\doxysubsubsection{Point or Time-\/\+Serie output}\label{Manual_autotoc_md49}
For each Time-\/\+Serie output needed, a line with the destination file and the postition is needed\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{TSnodesout=Offshore.txt,xloc,yloc;}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The file contains 5 colums $(t, zs, h, u,v)$ with the value at the nearest grid point (to the position defined by the user).\hypertarget{Manual_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysubsection{Adaptative grid}\label{Manual_autotoc_md50}
At the stage of development, the code will adapt the grid only before the computation but not along the calcul.

The code is based on a Block-\/uniform quadtree mesh. Each block, actually a 16 by 16 cells, is one unit of computation in the GPU. These blocks can have different resolutions (but the resolution does not change during the computation at this stage).

By default, the initial resolution of the grid is the resolution of the bathymetry/topographic data. To refine or coarsen the grid, you can weather use the \char`\"{}dx\char`\"{} key word and choose a new resolution for the whole domain; wether use different levels of resolution. The reference level, correponding to the bathymetry resolution or \char`\"{}dx\char`\"{} if defined by the user, will be the level 0. Levels of resolution are then defined in relation to the reference levels using positive integers to increase the resolution or refine and negative integer to coarsen the grid by a multiple of two. For a given level $n$ , the resolution $dx_n$ will be\+: \$\$dx\+\_\+n=\textbackslash{}frac\{dx\+\_\+0\}\{2$^\wedge$n\}\$\$

with $dx_0$ the resolution at level 0.

When refinning using the level implementation, different key words are expected\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initlevel\+: level used to create the first mesh created by the code in the mesh refinement process (only a technical information)
\item Maxlevel\+: maximim level of refinement (over-\/ruling other commands)
\item Minlevel\+: minimum level of refinement (over-\/ruling other commands)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The grid can also be unregular with an adaptition of the grid to the model (variables at initialisation step or user-\/defined refinement map). In this case, the cells will be devided in 4 cells for refinement, or 4 cells merged in one for coarsening. The code will ensure a progressive change of resolution (no cell should have a neighbour with more than 1 level of resolution of difference.)

The different methods of refinement available in the code are called using the key word \char`\"{}\+Adaptation\char`\"{}. The refinement can be based on a classical input variable or a variable calculated during the initialisation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \textquotesingle{}Threshold\textquotesingle{}\+: impose a threshold for a different level of resolution
\item \textquotesingle{}Inrange\textquotesingle{}\+: impose a range for a different level of resolution
\item \textquotesingle{}Targetlevel\textquotesingle{}\+: the levels of resolution will be targeted but will be overruled by the maxlevel, minlevel entrance.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For example, for the adaptation with targeted levels\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{initlevel = init ;}
\DoxyCodeLine{maxlevel =  \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceutils_aeba68c7a52d2689b740394f49c278ed8}{max}} ;}
\DoxyCodeLine{minlevel = \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceutils_a735e525aa0ca6cf818f4823385086077}{min}} ;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{Adaptation_8cu_a185d47978609c5d1cfbd6ce1c9cdbbce}{Adaptation}} = Targetlevel,MyLevelMap.nc?levels ;}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Where max and min represent the range of level expected, and init is a number in this range (it is advice to use the min level). My\+Level\+Map is a netcdf 2D map of levels, that can have a different resolution and dimension from the computational grid. The amplitude of the levels on the map can also be larger than than min/max. All these levels are positive or negative integer.

For a bathymetry map of 10m resolution ( or $ dx=10m$), we can use $min=-3$, $max=2$ and $init=-3$ to create a grid where coarser cell will be $10/2^-3=80m$ and the thinner $10/2=2.5m$. The level file would contains a 2D map with integer values from -\/3 to 2.
